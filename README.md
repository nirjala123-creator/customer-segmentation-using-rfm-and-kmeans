Customer behavior analysis using RFM framework and KMeans clustering to identify high-value and at-risk customers.
Customer Segmentation using RFM & KMeans

Project Overview

This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) framework. Customers are segmented into meaningful groups using KMeans clustering to identify high-value, regular, and at-risk customers.

 Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Apply RFM analysis to evaluate customer behavior

Use KMeans clustering for customer segmentation

Generate business insights and recommendations

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Scikit-learn

📈 Key Findings

Identified three customer segments:
High-Value Customers – recent, frequent, high spending
Regular Customers – moderate engagement
At-Risk Customers – low spending, inactive
High-value customers contribute significantly to revenue.
Customers with higher recency show potential churn risk.

💡 Business Recommendations

Reward high-value customers through loyalty programs.
Re-engage at-risk customers using targeted marketing campaigns.
Personalize offers based on customer segment.
